### How to get my project included?

Fork this repo, create a new branch, and then change the `src/data/projects.js` file. 

Make sure to also add the image in the `src/assets/images/projects` folder, unless you'll add an image link from a third-party source. The image should not be too big (try less than 200kb), so that it does not load too long.

After you make the necessary changes, create a PR in this repo.
